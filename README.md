# Miscellaneous Homebrew Packages

A couple of personal formula:

  - _ssh2_: built from the last open source version of the SSH.COM sources.
  - _mutt-kz_: the Notmuch-enabled fork of the best MUA in the 'verse.

Only the ssh2, scp2, sftp2, ssh-keygen2, ssh-agent2 and ssh-add2 
binaries will be installed.

Man pages for those binaries and ssh2_config will also be installed.

To use the repo as a Homebrew tap:

```
brew tap bpeisenbraun/homebrew-misc
brew install ssh2 # etc
```
