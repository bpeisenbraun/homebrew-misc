# SSH2 Homebrew Package

This package is built from the last open source version of the 
SSH.COM sources.

Only the ssh2, scp2, sftp2, ssh-keygen2, ssh-agent2 and ssh-add2 
binaries will be installed.

Man pages for those binaries and ssh2_config.1 will also be installed.

To use it:

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bpeisenbraun/homebrew/master/ssh2.rb
```
