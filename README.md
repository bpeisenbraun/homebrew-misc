# Miscellaneous Homebrew Packages

The only thing here right now is the _ssh2_ package, which is built 
from the last open source version of the SSH.COM sources.

Only the ssh2, scp2, sftp2, ssh-keygen2, ssh-agent2 and ssh-add2 
binaries will be installed.

Man pages for those binaries and ssh2_config will also be installed.

To use it:

```
brew tap bpeisenbraun/homebrew-misc
brew install ssh2
```
